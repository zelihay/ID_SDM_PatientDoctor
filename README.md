Influence Diagram-Based Modeling of Shared Decision-Making

The codes of the Simulation dataset are in the file DoctorPatient_16.12.2024.ipynb. Make sure you change the number of repetition in the codes: repetitions = 1. This number represents the number of iterations for each combination of the parameters. 

SDM_Functions_v05 stores all the functions that we call in DoctorPatient_16.12.2024.ipynb, so make sure you change the path of the file where it is located. All 4 files should be stayed in the same folder to make the process easier.
